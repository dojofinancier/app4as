# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting significant technical decisions made during the development of the 4AS Tutor Booking Application.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help us:
- Understand why certain technical choices were made
- Avoid repeating past discussions
- Onboard new team members
- Make informed decisions in the future

## ADR Index

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|------|

## Status Values

- **Proposed:** Decision is being discussed
- **Accepted:** Decision has been made and implemented
- **Deprecated:** Decision is no longer valid
- **Superseded:** Decision has been replaced by another ADR

## Creating a New ADR

1. Copy `template.md` to `adr-XXX-title.md` (replace XXX with next number)
2. Fill in the template with your decision
3. Update this README with the new ADR entry
4. Reference the ADR in relevant code or documentation
